# Spider-Robot-for-Facade-Cleaning
**Hexapod Robot** which uses the **Tripod Gait** mechanism to move forward and a **Pneumatic** system to scale glass walls.

## Tech Stack : 
1) CATIA for designing the robot
2) Arduino Mega 2560 to operate the eighteen NEMA17 motors which are used on the robot's legs
3) ROS framework to implement the tripod gait mechanism by synchronizing the six legs of the robots.

### Design of the Spider Robot:

Each Leg of the robot emulates a real spider's leg and was built using three NEMA 17 dual shaft motors.

### Walking Mechanism of the Spider Robot
The six legs move in the order shown in the following diagram. This is known as the Tripod Gait Mechanism.
